# Default emoji(bool) replaceSome = false
If you don't want to customize emojis and prefer to use the default emojis, set replaceSome to false:
```dart
  DksFunnyText(
          simpleText: false,
          replaceSome: false,
          text: "Flutter DksFunnyText",
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
        ),
 ```

# Customize emoji(bool) replaceSome = true
If you want to customize the emojis used for specific characters, set replaceSome to true, and provide a Map<String, dynamic> of characters and their corresponding emojis:
```dart
  Map<String, dynamic> emoji = {"A": 'ðŸ˜‡', "C": 'ðŸ˜„'};

  DksFunnyText(
          simpleText: false,
          replaceSome: true,
          emoji: emoji,
          text: "Flutter DksFunnyText",
          style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
        ),
```
